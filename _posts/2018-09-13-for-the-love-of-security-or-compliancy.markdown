Often during engagements one has to wonder...<br>
Does the client truly <s>loves</s> values security, or is this another...
>"To be compliant for production release, you need to get a <b>pen test!</b>" 

Most of the time, the engagement happens because of compliancy sake, and this is disheartening because they do not really care about the security vulnerabilities in their application.

And this is often the case in big <s>financial</s> corporates. Trust me, you will hate it.

In corporates, application<b>s</b> are deployed at an unimaginable speed. Projects are often delayed due to high impact vulnerabilities discovered by your security testing and when this happens, shit will hit the fan.

Thousands of argument will be made againsts you just to convince you how your `unauthenticated remote code execution` on their internet-facing application should not be a high severity vulnerability, because their users are "good people" and "non-technical".

No really, very often their argument doesn't even makes sense, because the project manager probably ain't even technical at all.

Instead of feeling appreciated, you will feel like a complete dick because you are now officially their "blocker" for production release. 

Situations like this are very toxic. It might makes you question your job, your purpose, and whatever you're doing. Is it truly for the greater good? 

Preventing their application from being hacked the very next day is important, but shifting your perspective into the delivery team shoes, perhaps meeting their go-live date is their utmost priority.

On a positive side; Ultimately we the tester has the final say, since we will be the one writing the final report. Do not feel pressured to lower your precious RCE's severity and be proud of whatever you write down in the report. Afterall it is our job and duty to do so.

So how many engagements have you personally encountered that is "For the Love of Security", and how many is "For the Love of Compliancy"?
