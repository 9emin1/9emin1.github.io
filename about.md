### Welcome!
This web page will be used to document my Information Security/Cyber career. I am currently based in Singapore and work for NCC Group, under their APAC branch as a Senior Security Consultant. My job scope involves technical delivery AKA Penetration Testing.

I currently hold a Bachelor Degree of Computer Science, Digital System Security from University of Wollongong, as well as a Diploma, Cyber Digital Security from Temasek Polytechnic in Singapore. I also possess a few certifications in Information Security:

* CREST CCT App (2018 - 2021)
* CREST CRT (2016 - 2019)
* CREST CPSA (2016 - 2019)

* Offensive Security - OSCP
* Offensive Security - OSWP

* SANS - GCIH 504

I enjoy breaking stuff and sometimes building stuff during my free time. One of the benefit in this field is the never-ending learning process.

Below is a brief timeline of my career so far. I will be updating it annually

### 2019

Current: Senior Security Consultant for NCC Group, APAC, based in Singapore

### 2018

I got promoted to a Senior title this year in Vantage Point Security, and I also chose to depart nearing the year end..

This year was great as well! I was given the opportunity to visit California, San Jose in US for the OWASP AppSec 2018 Conference as a trainer for the workshop Mobile Security Testing, together with my colleague Sven.

The workshop was great, attendees were awesome, the conference was held at FairMont Hotel. The CTF was fun too! Managed to snipe the 5th place, winning a rubber ducky.

I was getting pretty bored with mainly projects revolving around applications (mobile and web) and decided to part ways with Vantage Point Security to pursue an environment that can provide more variety.

I managed to clear my CREST CCT APP exam too! On my second try.

### 2017

At this point my time and effort probably paid off! I woke up one day and suddenly everything makes sense to me. I am now able to explain technical vulnerabilities in layman terms, even subtle misconfiguration issues like the Lack of Content Security Policy. I was also making contributions to the community by submitting writeups on vulnerable machines, doing responsible disclosure, fuzzing for zero days in open sourced softwares, etc.

I was also involved in conducting workshops for my clients, covering OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities and creating custom content for hands-on exercises. 

Ending the year off, I was awarded the "Best Overall Hack of 2017" by my employer!

Life's great.

### 2016

I left my job as a Security Analyst and joined Vantage Point Security in Singapore, as a Security Consultant. My job scope was mainly delivering technical assessment, penetration testing, tons of mobile and web application, a few internal network testing, a few full-blown testing, code review, etc.

The first few weeks/months were spent shadowing a more senior consultant, truck-load of knowledge to digest, ton of self-learning to do. OSCP does not cover applications in-depth apart from the common and more simple stuff like XSS and SQL Injection. A good environment I learned the quickest was deploying my own instance of DVWA, bWAPP, WebGoat, and completing every exercises in them.

This role requires me to fully understand what are the causes and how to fix them. Also explaining them to a non-technical person (your client) was tough.

Apparently you can't "Hack the Planet" and go home after. Who knows?

### 2015

Got my first "proper" job after completing my National Service (NS/Army in Singapore). It was a Security Analyst role in a Security Operation Center (SoC) environment. My job scope mainly involves investigating triggered alert, examine PCAP captures, device (WAF, IDS, IPS) troubleshooting, and a few ad-hoc duties. 

The requirements for this job was quite basic (just like the salary) as it is a junior role. The interview process involves a few technical questions like basic IP concepts and common protocols, attacks, etc.

Initially my employer was named e-Cop, it got rebranded as Quann and now they collaborated with StarHub's security branch and further rebranded themselves as Ensign InfoSecurity.

This is the place which sparked my interest for security. I was exposed to various kind of cyber attacks and I spent a ton of my time researching and understanding the concepts behind them. 

Examples include completing my SANS GCIH certification, getting my OSCP, CREST CPSA, and CRT certifications. I self-paid my OSCP and CREST certifications as they were not directly related to my job. (More towards penetration testing)
